# Mobile-Sales-Intelligence-Report-PowerBI
## Project Objective
This Power BI dashboard project aims to analyze mobile phone sales data to generate meaningful insights for better business decision-making. The dataset includes fields such as transaction ID, date, brand, units sold, customer details, city, payment method, ratings, and mobile model. Using Power Query and DAX, the analysis focuses on evaluating total sales, quantities sold, transaction volume, and average sales. The dashboard highlights top-performing brands and models, visualizes sales trends over months and weekdays, and shows city-wise performance on a map. It also provides insights into customer ratings and preferred payment methods. Interactive slicers allow users to filter data by month and brand, making it a dynamic and insightful tool for sales tracking, market analysis, and strategic planning.
